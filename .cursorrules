Base Project: OneFormer3D
Source Repository: https://github.com/filaPro/oneformer3d

Project Overview:
OneFormer3D is a unified 3D point cloud segmentation framework that simultaneously handles:
- Semantic segmentation
- Instance segmentation
- Panoptic segmentation

Key Features:
- Transformer-based architecture
- Shared encoder-decoder structure
- End-to-end training capability

Development Goal:
Create a building segmentation system for multimodal urban scene data alignment with enhanced accuracy and robustness.

Multimodal Inputs:
1. Multi-view scene images
2. Scene point clouds
3. Scene text descriptions

Technical Approach:
Building upon OneFormer3D:
1. Add multi-view image input branch
2. Process flow:
   - Voxelize original point cloud
   - Extract features via sparse-unet
   - Obtain spatial features for each voxel
   - Project voxels onto image plane using image poses
   - Query visual features for each voxel
   - Combine spatial and multi-view image features per voxel
   - Process downstream tasks
